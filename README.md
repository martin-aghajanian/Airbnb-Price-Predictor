# Airbnb Listing Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the prices of Airbnb listings based on various features such as location, property type, number of rooms, amenities, and more. Using a dataset of Airbnb listings, the model leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price predictions. The project includes:

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Gathering and preprocessing the Airbnb listing data to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights that inform feature selection.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting relevant features that improve the model's predictive performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data science, machine learning, and practical application of predictive analytics.
